1). Install virtual machine through given link
```
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
```

2). Create a new OS with type as Linux and version as Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) (64-bit)


3). Allocate adequate memory and use existing virtual disk file (add path to provided 26GB .vdi file)

4). Finish the process and start the OS by clicking on the start arrow

  <summary> Introduction to RISC-V ISA </summary>

  RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is assembly level language which only RISC-V hardware layout understands. It is designed to communicate instructions with the computer. Since every layout is custom designed one can definetly expect unique instruction set (for e.g- To add two data values the command 'addi rd, rs1, rs2 is used; whereas 8051 microcontroller uses 'add a, b' to add the same two data values.)

  Various instructions in RISC-V are listed below:

  1.)Pseudo instructions (for e.g- mv rd, rs1)

  2.)Base integer instructions(RV64I)(RV32I) (for e.g- addi, lui)

  3.)Multiply extension(RV64M)(RV32M) (for e.g- divw, mulw)

  4.)Single(RV64F) & double(RV64D) precision floating point extension (for e.g- flw, fadd)

  5.)Application binary interface

  6.)Memory allocation & stack pointer (for e.g- a1, sp, 8)
