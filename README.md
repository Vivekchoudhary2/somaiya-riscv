1). Install virtual machine through given link
```
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
```

2). Create a new OS with type as Linux and version as Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) (64-bit)


3). Allocate adequate memory and use existing virtual disk file (add path to provided 26GB .vdi file)

4). Finish the process and start the OS by clicking on the start arrow

  <summary> Introduction to RISC-V ISA </summary>

  RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is set of instructions which only RISC-V hardware layout understands. Since each layout is designed uniquely one can definetly expect unique instruction set (for e.g- To add two data values the command 'addi rd, rs1, rs2 is used; whereas 8051 microcontroller uses 'add a, b' to add the same two data values.)

  Machine does not understand human language; it only understands 1's and 0's. And humans definitely cannot communicate in 1's and 0's.
  
  How humans take aid of machines to do the same task again and again?
